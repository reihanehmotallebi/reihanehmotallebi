## Exploring Data-Driven Solutions

I am an industrial engineer with a data-driven approach, currently undergoing a Digital Transformation traineeship at the [Digital Society School](https://digitalsocietyschool.org/) in Amsterdam, Netherlands. My goal is to enhance my expertise in data science and digital transformation, leveraging data to drive innovation and informed decision-making.

## Experience

I have experience as a Linguistic Data Analyst at the [Academy of Persian Language and Literature](https://apll.ir/), where I worked with extensive terminological datasets to enhance workflow efficiency. As a Terminology Expert at the [Research Center of Terminology Studies](https://apll.ir/rcts/), I supported research and decision-making through data-driven approaches in terminology management.

Additionally, I have worked as an editor at [Goman Publication](https://gomanbook.com/), contributing to various translations and publications. As the Chief Operating Officer at [Lahn-e Digar](https://www.instagram.com/lahnedigar/), I led operations, implemented Scrum methodology, and established a recording studio for high-quality audiobook production.
